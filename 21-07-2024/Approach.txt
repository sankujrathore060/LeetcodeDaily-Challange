### Approach

The given solution involves several steps to construct a matrix using topological sorting for both row and column constraints. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Topological Sort Function (`TopologicalSort`)**:
    - **Input**: `rowGraph`, `k`
    - **Initialization**: Create an `indegree` list to keep track of the number of incoming edges for each node.
    - **Calculate Indegree**: Iterate over the `rowGraph` and increment the indegree of the destination nodes.
    - **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue with nodes having 0 indegree.
    - **Process Queue**: Dequeue nodes, add them to the result list, and decrease the indegree of their children. Enqueue children with 0 indegree.
    - **Output**: Return the topological order of nodes.

2. **Merge Condition Function (`MergeCondition`)**:
    - **Input**: `condition`, `k`
    - **Graph Creation**: Create a graph representation from the given conditions.
    - **Topological Sort**: Call `TopologicalSort` on the graph and return the result.

3. **Build Matrix Function (`BuildMatrix`)**:
    - **Input**: `k`, `rowConditions`, `colConditions`
    - **Topological Sort**: Get the topological sort for both row and column conditions.
    - **Validation**: Check if the topological sort results are valid.
    - **Matrix Construction**: Construct the matrix based on the topological sorts of rows and columns.

### Time and Space Complexity

#### Topological Sort Function (`TopologicalSort`)

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Calculating indegree takes O(E) time where E is the number of edges.
  - Initializing the queue takes O(V) time where V is the number of nodes.
  - Processing the queue takes O(V + E) time because each node and each edge is processed once.
  - Overall: O(V + E)

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Storing the indegree list takes O(V) space.
  - The queue can take up to O(V) space in the worst case.
  - The adjacency list `rowGraph` takes O(E) space.
  - Overall: O(V + E)

#### Merge Condition Function (`MergeCondition`)

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Creating the graph takes O(E) time.
  - Calling `TopologicalSort` takes O(V + E) time.
  - Overall: O(V + E)

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Storing the graph takes O(E) space.
  - Calling `TopologicalSort` has space complexity O(V + E).
  - Overall: O(V + E)

#### Build Matrix Function (`BuildMatrix`)

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Calling `MergeCondition` twice, each taking O(V + E), results in O(2(V + E)) = O(V + E).
  - Constructing the matrix involves iterating over the topological sorts and constructing the matrix in O(V^2) time.
  - Overall: O(V + E + V^2)

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Storing the row and column topological sorts takes O(V) space each.
  - Constructing the matrix takes O(V^2) space.
  - Overall: O(V + E + V^2)

In this context, V = k and E depends on the number of conditions provided. The complexities are:

- **Topological Sort**: O(k + E)
- **Merge Condition**: O(k + E)
- **Build Matrix**: O(k + E + k^2)

For both time and space complexity, E represents the number of conditions, and k represents the number of nodes (or size of the matrix).
